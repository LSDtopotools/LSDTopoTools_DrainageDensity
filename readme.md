LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity
==============================

This repository contains the code to get the drainage density of all third order basins in the landscape (Clubb et al., 2016, JGR:ES).  In order to run the channel extraction algorithm the FFTW library must be downloaded and placed in the LSDTopoTools_DrainageDensity folder.  It can be downloaded from: http://www.fftw.org/

For documentation and instructions on how to run the code, please see our online tutorials at:
